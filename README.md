## Background of the problem statement:

You are a web developer at a company that provides web solutions. The company was approached by a client to build a food blog app where users can read, write, edit, or delete new and existing posts. During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop the frontend using Angular. The backend developers have agreed to provide you with the required APIs to perform CRUD operations on the data. The tasks you are responsible for include:

## Designing the app in Angular
Creating routes for navigation between Angular pages and components
Creating service for accessing REST API
Setting up a JSON server for testing until backend APIs are ready
Testing the application
You must use the following tools:

Angular: To build the application
NgModules: To configure the injector and the compiler and organize related components
JSON Server: To build a placeholder backend for app development and testing
Angular Router: To navigate within the app using URL links
Jasmine/Karma: To test the application
Following requirements should be met:

The app should be responsive.
The app should have functionalities for users to create, view, update, and delete posts.
The app should have a contact form, a header, and a nav component.
# Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
